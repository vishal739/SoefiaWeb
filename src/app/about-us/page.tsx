        <p>
          <strong>Soefia Education</strong> was founded in 2024 by experienced
          B2B technology leaders with the vision to empower our schools to bring
          students together and increase their engagement with each other, in
          the real world, to achieve greater human and academic achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leveraging AI, our mission is to improve the academic outcomes of K-12
          students in the U.S. while promoting their mental well-being. We
          accomplish this by facilitating frequent and effective collaborative
          learning within classrooms. By enhancing mental well-being and social
          interaction, along with mastery of diverse subjects and teamwork
          skills, we will support more effective schools and contribute to
          better societal outcomes for all.
