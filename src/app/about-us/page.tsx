        <p > 
          <strong>Soefia Education</strong> was founded in 2024 by experienced
          B2B technology leaders with the vision to empower our schools to bring
          students together and increase their engagement with each other, in
          the real world, to achieve greater human and academic achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will increase the social development and mental well-being of K-12
          students in the US, while also improving their academic outcomes, by
          facilitating frequent and effective collaborative learning instruction
          within their classes. This improved emotional well-being and
          socialization, better mastery of important and diverse subject matter
          domains, and the learning of more effective collaboration and
          team-based work practices by our K-12 students will lead to more
          effective schools and better societal outcomes for humanity.
