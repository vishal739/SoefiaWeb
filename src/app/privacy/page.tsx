        <p>
          We, <strong>Soefia Education Inc.</strong>, take your data privacy and protection seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have no rights to appropriate or sell student or school data, and we do not collect, maintain, use, or share student personal information beyond that needed for authorized educational or school purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We adhere to the national <strong>Student Privacy Pledge</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>This Pledge states the following:</p>

        <p>
          K-12 School Service Providers are honored to be entrusted by educators and families to support their educational needs and school operations. School Service Providers take responsibility to both support the effective use of student information and safeguard student privacy and information security.
        </p>

        <p>
          School Service Providers support schools – including their teachers, students, and parents – to manage student data, carry out school operations, support instruction and learning opportunities, and develop and improve products/services intended for educational/school use. In so doing, it is critical that schools and School Service Providers build trust by effectively protecting the privacy of student information and communicating with parents about how student information is used and safeguarded. Student PII is provided by students, their parents, and their schools; it should be used to serve and support students’ best interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          We pledge to carry out responsible stewardship and appropriate use of Student PII according to the commitments below and in adherence to all laws applicable to us as School Service Providers.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">We Commit To:</h2>

        <ul className="list-none list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>❌ We will not collect, maintain, use, or share Student PII beyond that needed for authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.</li>
          <li>❌ We will not sell student PII.</li>
          <li>❌ We will not use or disclose student information collected through an educational/school service (whether personal information or otherwise) for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.</li>
          <li>❌ We will not build a personal profile of a student other than for supporting authorized educational/school purposes or as authorized by the parent/student.</li>
          <li>❌ We will not make material changes to School Service Provider education privacy policies without first providing prominent notice to the users and/or account holder(s) (i.e., the institution/agency, or the parent/student when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent) and allowing them choices before data is used in any manner inconsistent with terms they were initially provided; and not make material changes to other policies or practices governing the use of Student PII that are inconsistent with contractual requirements.</li>
          <li>❌ We will not knowingly retain Student PII beyond the time period required to support the authorized educational/school purposes, or as authorized by the parent/student.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        ✅ We will collect, use, share, and retain Student PII only for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher, or the parent/student.
        </p>

        <p>
        ✅We will disclose clearly in contracts or privacy policies, including in a manner easy for institutions and parents to find and understand, what types of Student PII we collect, if any, and the purposes for which the information we maintain is used or shared with third parties.
        </p>

        <p>
        ✅ We will support access to and correction of Student PII by the student or their authorized parent, either by assisting the educational institution in meeting its requirements or directly when the information is collected directly from the student with student/parent consent.
        </p>

        <p>
        ✅We will maintain a comprehensive security program that is reasonably designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Student PII against risks – such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure – through the use of administrative, technological, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.
        </p>

        <p>
        ✅We will provide resources to support educational institutions/agencies, teachers, or parents/students to protect the security and privacy of Student PII while using the educational service.
        </p>

        <p>
        ✅ We will require that our vendors with whom Student PII is shared in order to deliver the educational service, if any, are obligated to follow these same commitments for the given Student PII.
        </p>

        <p>
        ✅We will allow a successor entity to maintain the Student PII, in the case of our merger or acquisition by another entity, provided the successor entity is subject to these same commitments for the previously collected Student PII.
        </p>

        <p>
          ✅We will incorporate privacy and security when developing or improving our educational products, tools, and services and comply with applicable laws.
